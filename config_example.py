# This is a demonstration of how settings can be customized
# You can edit simulation/config.py directly to change parameters

# Example: Increase initial populations
PREY_INITIAL_COUNT = 80
PREDATOR_INITIAL_COUNT = 20

# Example: Make predators faster
PREDATOR_MAX_SPEED = 5.0

# Example: Increase mutation rate for faster evolution
MUTATION_RATE = 0.2

# Example: More food
FOOD_COUNT = 120
